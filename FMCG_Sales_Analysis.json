{"Exploratory Data Analysis on FMCG Sales Dataset\n\nFMCG Dataset \u2013 Overview\n\nThis dataset simulates daily-level transactional data for products sold\nin the Fast-Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) sector between 2022 and 2024.\n\nThis is designed to support analysis of:\n\n-   Seasonality and product lifecycle\n-   Promotion and holiday effects\n-   Stockouts and inventory dynamics\n-   Demand forecasting and feature engineering\n\nEach row represents one SKU on a specific day, across different sales\nchannels and region. This project is intended for educational and\nportfolio-building purposes.\n\n-   Link to the dataset we are using for our practice\n\n(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/beatafaron/fmcg-daily-sales-data-to-2022-2024?select": "FMCG_2022_2024.csv)\n\n-   The data has been manipulated after it was downloaded from Kaggle.\n    This is because the data didn't have enough information to support\n    our analysis. In order to be able to have a clean and consistent\n    analysis, we added some few informations to the dataset. This\n    eventually will make our analysis an hypothetical analysis.\n\nFour our columns, each record includes", "\n\n-   date: Date of the sales record\n-   sku: Stock Keeping Unit (unique product ID)\n-   brand: Brand name of the product\n-   segment: Product segment (e.g., premium, standard, economy)\n-   category: Product category (e.g., Beverages, Snacks)\n-   channel: Sales channel (e.g., Retail, E-commerce)\n-   region: Region where the sale occurred\n-   pack_type: Packaging type\n-   price_unit: Price per single unit\n-   promotion_flag: Whether the sale occurred under promotion (1 ": null, "\n\n    df.tail()\n\n                  date     sku     brand        segment  category     channel  \\\n    190752  12/31/2024  SN-030  SnBrand2  SnackBar-Seg1  SnackBar    Discount   \n    190753  12/31/2024  SN-030  SnBrand2  SnackBar-Seg1  SnackBar    Discount   \n    190754  12/31/2024  SN-030  SnBrand2  SnackBar-Seg1  SnackBar  E-commerce   \n    190755  12/22/2024  MI-022  MiBrand3      Milk-Seg2      Milk      Retail   \n    190756  12/31/2024  SN-030  SnBrand2  SnackBar-Seg1  SnackBar  E-commerce   \n\n                region pack_type  price_unit  promotion_flag  delivery_days  \\\n    190752    PL-North    Single        2.55               0              2   \n    190753    PL-South    Single        6.01               0              5   \n    190754  PL-Central    Single        3.45               0              5   \n    190755    PL-North    Carton        8.45               0              3   \n    190756    PL-South    Single        1.91               0              5   \n\n            stock_available  delivered_qty  units_sold  \n    190752            190.0          163.0          25  \n    190753            141.0          131.0          19  \n    190754              0.0          132.0           0  \n    190755            166.0          177.0          10  \n    190756             82.0          125.0           8  \n\nData Cleaning\n\nBefore analysis, I need to ensure that the data is properly cleaned and\nreliable for my analysis.\n\n    # Preview data\n\n    df.info()\n\n    <class 'pandas.core.frame.DataFrame'>\n    RangeIndex: 190757 entries, 0 to 190756\n    Data columns (total 14 columns):\n     #   Column           Non-Null Count   Dtype  \n    ---  ------           --------------   -----  \n     0   date             190757 non-null  object \n     1   sku              190757 non-null  object \n     2   brand            190757 non-null  object \n     3   segment          190757 non-null  object \n     4   category         190757 non-null  object \n     5   channel          190757 non-null  object \n     6   region           190757 non-null  object \n     7   pack_type        190757 non-null  object \n     8   price_unit       190757 non-null  float64\n     9   promotion_flag   190757 non-null  int64  \n     10  delivery_days    190757 non-null  int64  \n     11  stock_available  190752 non-null  float64\n     12  delivered_qty    190754 non-null  float64\n     13  units_sold       190757 non-null  int64  \n    dtypes: float64(3), int64(3), object(8)\n    memory usage: 20.4+ MB\n\n    # Converting multiple columns to their proper datatypes\n\n    df[\"date\"] ": null}
